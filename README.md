  Hi everyone, Lucas here

- I learned front-end by myself during the pandemic, but I want to dive into understanding more about the back-end world ♥️ 

- My goal is to have front and back-end well structured and be able to reach them more easily and efficiently.
  I think it's a good idea to keep front-end as a experimentation pursuit to my self and back-end as a professional area.
  This way I can enhance my productivity and my proficiency into different fields of knowledge. 
  By creating clear boundaries and focusing on individual areas, I can navigate and engage with each field more cohesively.
  I'll be able to access resources more efficiently and apply both into each other.
