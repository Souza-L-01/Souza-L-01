  Hi everyone, Lucas here

- I learned front-end by myself during the pandemic, but I want to dive into understanding more about the Data world ♥️
During the pandemic, I took the initiative to learn front-end development independently. However, my curiosity and passion have now sparked a desire to delve deeper into the fascinating realm of data. I am eager to expand my knowledge and gain a comprehensive understanding of the data world, allowing me to explore its possibilities and contribute effectively.

- I want to separate fields to be able to reach them more easily and efficiently.
To enhance my productivity and proficiency, I aim to compartmentalize different fields of knowledge. By creating clear boundaries and focusing on individual areas, I can navigate and engage with each field more effortlessly. This approach will enable me to streamline my learning process, access resources more efficiently, and excel in each field with greater precision and effectiveness.
